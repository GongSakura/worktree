- ðŸ˜¡ Are you annoyed with the frequent **"git checkout/stash/pop"** during coding?
- ðŸ˜­ Do you often **jump around** different projects(VS Code windows)?
- ðŸ¤ª Would you like a **natty gadget** to help you handle these messes? **Let's try it out!**

- If the \<branch-name\> has already been checkout, then the command will fail.
- If the \<branch-name\> doesn't existed, it will create a new branch based on HEAD
- If you want to create a worktree with a new branch that based on a commit or branch, use **"wt add --base \<commit-hash\> \<branch-name\>"**

<br/>

### 4. "wt rm \<branch-name\>"

- To remove a worktree based on the \<branch-name\>.

- If you want to remove the branch at the same time, use **"wt rm -f \<branch-name\>"**

<br/>

### 5. "wt update"

- To inspect all changes that related to "git branch" and "git worktree", then regenerate configuration and repair worktrees.
